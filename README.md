# LaunchDarkly Go Configuration Types

[![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/launchdarkly/go-configtypes.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/launchdarkly/go-configtypes) [![Documentation](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=go.dev&message=reference&color=00add8)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/launchdarkly/go-configtypes)

This project contains Go types and functions that are meant to simplify and standardize text-based configuration options. There is a basic set of types for strongly typed values with or without validation rules, which can be used with any text parsing code that recognizes the encoding.TextMarshaler interface. The same types can also be read from environment variables in a standard way.

This version of the module supports Go version 1.21 or higher.

For more information, see the package documentation.

## About LaunchDarkly

* LaunchDarkly is a continuous delivery platform that provides feature flags as a service and allows developers to iterate quickly and safely. We allow you to easily flag your features and manage them from the LaunchDarkly dashboard.  With LaunchDarkly, you can:
    * Roll out a new feature to a subset of your users (like a group of users who opt-in to a beta tester group), gathering feedback and bug reports from real-world use cases.
    * Gradually roll out a feature to an increasing percentage of users, and track the effect that the feature has on key metrics (for instance, how likely is a user to complete a purchase if they have feature A versus feature B?).
    * Turn off a feature that you realize is causing performance problems in production, without needing to re-deploy, or even restart the application with a changed configuration file.
    * Grant access to certain features based on user attributes, like payment plan (eg: users on the ‘gold’ plan get access to more features than users in the ‘silver’ plan). Disable parts of your application to facilitate maintenance, without taking everything offline.
* LaunchDarkly provides feature flag SDKs for a wide variety of languages and technologies. Check out [our documentation](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/docs) for a complete list.
